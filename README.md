# Rusty-42
42 projects from the piscine, all the way up to [INSERT CURRENT PROJECT] using Rust, cuz I'm a masochist.

# Why?
42's project-based learning proved extremely effective for learning C's basics in record-time, a language that intimidated me for ages! Rust seems like such a good language to learn; it combines the low-level control of C/C++ and the safety of higher-level programming languages. As someone who enjoys playing around with pointers, I feel like this language might be good for me! However, I do not intend to leave C behind; it's a lovely language, and officially, my first. It will always hold a place in my heart ^^

I took a look at Rust's website, [https://rust-lang.org], and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love with their documentation!! It will be my main reference throughout this "challenge". Anyway, without further ado, let the coding begin!!! >:D
